#SARIMAX:

The code below provides a step-by-step guide to performing time series analysis using the SARIMAX model to make future predictions based on a given dataset.
Here is a brief analysis of the code:

First, the tst() function generates a list of numbers where each number is the square of its index plus the index itself. For example,
the first number in the list is 00+0=0, the second number is 11+1=2, the third number is 2*2+2=6,and so on.
This function is used to create a sample time series data that has some nonlinear patterns.

Next, the create_sequence() function creates input/output pairs for the time series data, where the input sequence is a sliding window of past n_lookback values,
and the output sequence is the next n_forecast values. For example, if n_lookback is 3 and n_forecast is 2,
then the first input/output pair would be [0, 1, 2]/[3, 4], the second pair would be [1, 2, 3]/[4, 5], and so on.

The code loads the sample time series data into a pandas DataFrame called df.
The DataFrame has two columns: Date and Value. The Date column is just an index,
and the Value column contains the sample time series data.

The code plots the sample time series data using the matplotlib library.
The plot() method of the DataFrame is used to create a line plot of the time series.
The title(), xlabel(), and ylabel() methods are used to add a title and axis labels to the plot.

The code then checks the stationarity of the time series data using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
The ADF test is a statistical test that tests the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in a time series sample.
If the p-value returned by the ADF test is less than a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), then the null hypothesis is rejected,
and the time series is considered stationary. If the time series is non-stationary, the code applies first-order differencing to the time series to make it stationary.
Differencing is a common technique used to remove trends and make time series stationary.

The code fits a SARIMAX model to the time series data using the SARIMAX() function from the statsmodels.tsa.api module.
The order parameter of the SARIMAX model is set to (1, 0, 0), which means that the model has one autoregressive (AR) term and no moving average (MA) terms.
The seasonal_order parameter is set to (0, 0, 0, 0), which means that the model has no seasonal components. The SARIMAX model is a popular time series forecasting model that can capture both the AR and MA components of a time series.

The code prints a summary of the model results using the summary() method of the fitted model.
The summary includes information about the coefficients of the AR and MA terms, the standard errors, t-values, and p-values.
The summary can be used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model and to identify any potential issues such as multicollinearity or overfitting.

The code uses the fitted SARIMAX model to make predictions for the next n_forecast periods using the forecast() method of the fitted model.
The forecast() method returns an array of predicted values for the next n_forecast periods. The predicted values are in differenced form,
which means that they are the difference between the predicted value and the value at the previous time step.

The code converts the differenced forecast back to the original scale by cumulatively summing the forecast and adding the last value of the original time series.
This converts the differenced forecast to the same scale as the original time series.

Finally, the code plots the predicted values along with the original time series data using the plot() method of the DataFrame.
The original time series is plotted in blue, and the predicted values are plotted in red. The title(), xlabel(),
and ylabel() methods are used to add a title and axis labels to the plot.

#LSTM:

The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is designed to work with sequential data such as time series.
LSTM models are well-suited for time series forecasting because they can remember information from previous time steps and use it to make predictions.

In the code, the MinMaxScaler class is usedto scale the sample time series data to a range between 0 and 1.
Scaling the data is a common preprocessing step for neural networks, as it can improve the convergence and stability of the model.

Next, the create_dataset() function creates input/output pairs for the time series data,
where the input sequence is a sliding window of past n_lookback values, and the output sequence is the next n_forecast values.
This function returns two NumPy arrays: X, which contains the input sequences, and y, which contains the output sequences.

The code splits the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from the sklearn.model_selection module. 
The training set contains 70% of the data, and the testing set contains 30% of the data.

The LSTM model is defined using the Sequential() class from the keras.models module. 
The model consists of a single LSTM layer with 50 units, followed by a dense output layer with 1 unit. 
The input_shape parameter of the LSTM layer is set to (n_lookback, 1), which means that the input sequences have n_lookback time steps and 1 feature. 
The activation parameter of the dense output layer is set to 'linear', which means that the output is a continuous value.

The code compiles the LSTM model using the compile() method of the model. 
The loss parameter is set to 'mean_squared_error', which is a common loss function used for regression problems. 
The optimizer parameter is set to 'adam', which is a popular optimizer for training neural networks.

The code trains the LSTM model on the training set using the fit() method of the model. 
The batch_size parameter is set to 1, which means that the model is trained on one input/output pair at a time. 
The epochs parameter is set to 100, which means that the model is trained for 100 iterations over the entire training set.

The code evaluates the performance of the LSTM model on the testing set using the evaluate() method of the model. 
The evaluate() method returns the mean squared error (MSE) of the model's predictions on the testing set.

The code uses the trained LSTM model to make predictions for the next n_forecast periods using the predict() method of the model. 
The predict() method returns an array of predicted values for the next n_forecast periods.

The code converts the scaled forecast back to the original scale using the inverse_transform() method of the MinMaxScaler object. 
This converts the scaled forecast to the same scale as the original time series.

Finally, the code plots the predicted values along with the original time series data using the matplotlib library. 
The original time series is plotted in blue, and the predicted values are plotted in red. The title(), xlabel(), 
and ylabel() methods are used to add a title and axis labels to the plot.

Overall, the SARIMAX and LSTM models are both powerful tools for time series forecasting. 
The SARIMAX model is a traditional statistical model that can capture the linear and nonlinear patterns in a time series,
while the LSTM model is a deep learning model that can learn complex patterns and dependencies in the data. Both models have their strengths and weaknesses, 
and the choice of model depends on the specific problem and dataset at hand.
