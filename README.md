# Comparing the Performance of SARIMAX and LSTM Models in Forecasting the Same Time Series Dataset"
Implementation of SARIMAX and LSTM Models for Time Series Forecasting in Python


I used SARIMAX, a time series model that extends the traditional ARIMA model to include exogenous variables, to forecast a time series in Python. SARIMAX is useful for modeling and forecasting time series data that exhibit complex features such as seasonal patterns and trends. Additionally, I compared the performance of SARIMAX with that of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), another time series model, in the same time series dataset.
