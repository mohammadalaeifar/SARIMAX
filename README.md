# SARIMAX and LSTM Time Series Forecasting
This repository contains code for time series forecasting using two popular models: SARIMAX and LSTM. The code provides step-by-step explanations of how to use each model to make future predictions based on a given time series dataset.

# What's included
The repository includes the following files:


# 1-SARIMAX Comparison with LSTM.ipynb:
A Jupyter notebook that provides a comparison of the SARIMAX and LSTM models for time series forecasting.
# 2-SARIMAX Comparison with LSTM(adds a new Dense layer).ipynb:
A Jupyter notebook that provides a comparison of the SARIMAX and LSTM models for time series forecasting, with the addition of a new Dense layer in the LSTM model.
# 3-A Step-by-Step Explanation of SARIMAX and LSTM Models for Time Series Forecasting.md:
A markdown file that provides a detailed explanation of how to use the SARIMAX and LSTM models to perform time series forecasting.

# How to use
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SARIMAX.git.
Install the required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open either SARIMAX Comparison with LSTM.ipynb or SARIMAX Comparison with LSTM(adds a new Dense layer).ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to perform time series analysis using the SARIMAX or LSTM model.
Experiment with different parameters and architectures to improve the model's performance on your specific time series dataset.
Example results
Here are some example results from running the code in the repository on the data.csv dataset:

SARIMAX: The SARIMAX model achieved an RMSE of 0.23 on the testing set.
LSTM: The LSTM model achieved an RMSE of 0.14 on the testing set.
LSTM with additional Dense layer: The LSTM model with an additional Dense layer achieved an RMSE of 0.12 on the testing set.
