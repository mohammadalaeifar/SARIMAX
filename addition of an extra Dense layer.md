The addition of an extra Dense layer to the LSTM model adds another layer of computation and introduces non-linearity to the model.
The Dense layer is a fully connected neural network layer that takes the outputs from the previous layer (in this case,
the output of the last LSTM layer) and performs a linear transformation followed by a non-linear activation function.

In the code provided, the Dense layer added has 64 neurons and a ReLU activation function. 
This means that each of the 64 neurons in the layer will compute a linear combination of the inputs from the previous layer (i.e., the output
of the last LSTM layer) and pass this value through the ReLU activation function, which will introduce non-linearity to the model. 
The output of the Dense layer will then be fed into the final Dense layer, which produces the final output of the model.

The addition of the Dense layer can potentially improve the performance of the LSTM model by allowing it to learn more complex relationships between
the input features and the output target. However, it is important to note that adding too many layers or neurons can lead to overfitting, 
where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. 
Therefore, it is important to experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to find the optimal model for the specific 
time series dataset being analyzed.                                                                                                                    
 However, it is important to note that the improvement in the output is not guaranteed, and adding too many layers or neurons can lead to overfitting, 
where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Therefore, it is important to experiment with different architectures and
hyperparameters to find the optimal model for the specific time series dataset being analyzed.

In the specific case of the code provided, the addition of the Dense layer with 64 neurons and a ReLU activation function improved the performance
of the LSTM model, as evidenced by the decrease in RMSE on the testing set compared to the LSTM model without the additional layer. 
However, the degree of improvement may vary depending on the specific time series dataset and the parameters used during training.
